ghu_industrial_ambitions_title: "Industrial Ambitions"
ghu_industrial_ambitions_desc: "Across the world, nations are embracing the power of industry to drive economic growth and development. To ensure that our empire remains competitive in this new era, we must pursue our own industrial ambitions. This includes investing in the development of factories, infrastructure, and technology that will enable us to produce goods on a large scale. By embracing industrialization, we can create jobs, boost our economy, and position our empire as a leading force in the global marketplace. We will make the transition from the age of serfdom and agrarian economy to that of industry and mechanization!"
ghu_mysore_rockets_title: "Mysore Rockets"
ghu_mysore_rockets_desc: "In South India, our Vassal in the Mysore region has developed a new kind of artillery, known as the Mysore rockets. These rockets are made of bamboo and iron, and are capable of causing massive damage to enemy formations. Light and portable, being able to be fire from both horseback and foot soldiers, it would be unwise to ignore this technology as we continue our expansion into India."
ghu_center_of_world_title: "Center of the World"
ghu_center_of_world_desc: "With our empire firmly established across the Indian subcontinent and into Southeast Asia, we have become a true center of the world. We must leverage our unique position to transform our humble empire into a true economic and bureaucratic powerhouse."
ghu_staple_ports_title: "Staple Ports of India"
ghu_staple_ports_desc: "India is the nexus of trade between the East and the West, and we must ensure that we have a strong presence in this region. We must establish staple ports in key locations, and ensure that our merchants have access to the wealth and resources of this vast and diverse land."
ghu_great_trunk_road_title: "The Great Trunk Road"
ghu_great_trunk_road_desc: "The Great Trunk Road is a vital artery of trade and commerce, connecting the far reaches of our empire. We must invest in the development of this road, and ensure that it is well-maintained and well-protected."
ghu_mesopotamia_title: "The Fertile Crescent"
ghu_mesopotamia_desc: "Mesopotamia, the land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, is a region of immense historical and cultural significance. As the cradle of civilization, it has been home to some of the world's earliest cities and empires. By establishing control over this fertile and resource-rich area, we can tap into its agricultural wealth, access vital trade routes, and strengthen our empire's position in the region while also reclaiming the lands of the ancient Persian capital of Ctesiphon."
ghu_ctesiphon_title: "Rebuild Ctesiphon"
ghu_ctesiphon_desc: "For hundreds of years, Ctesiphon stood as a ceremonious capital of Persia. Known as a place where several cities crowded, met and eventually merged, Ctesiphon was a vital geopolitical crossroad and some say one of the largest cities in the world. After the Muslim conquest however, the city fell into disarray. With vengeance on the menu, our advisors suggest we make from its ruins a city far greater, far more magnificent, far more wealthy than any seen before - a new Ctesiphon, a shining Ctesiphon!"
ghu_nahrawan_title: "Improve the Nahrawan"
ghu_nahrawan_desc: "During the times of Parthia, great works were undertaken along the Tigris and Euphrates to ensure water flowed where it was needed. Mesopotamia was fed by its convoluted, sprawling system of veins - farmers and peasants alike depending on the flow of its waters for sustenance and prosperity. Barbaric infighting and countless wars have seen the canals abused and razed however. Now that we are back in charge, it is our divine duty to see these great works restored and Mesopotamia prosper."
ghu_seljuks_title: "Chasten the Seljuks"
ghu_seljuks_desc: "The Seljuk Turks once shredded through Persia. Like the foul marauders they are, they wandered west, burning and desecrating all in sight until choosing to settle in the east of Anatolia. Their current rulers, their current peasantry, their current nobles, may have all forgotten their history, how their ancestors plundered us - but we have not. In due time, the Turks will be punished for their misdeeds - retribution will come."
ghu_persianize_turks_title: "Persianize the Turks"
ghu_persianize_turks_desc: "Anatolia is ours and with it, a sizable population of Turks. Their tenacity and wealth of manpower cannot be denied - they would make a fine addition to the empire, should they be educated and civilised. If we were to rid them of the various accumulated traditions and tongues clinging to them, we could assimilate the Turks beneath our cultural banner - make them Iranians, well and true, for centuries to come."
ghu_georgia_title: "Devastate Georgia"
ghu_georgia_desc: "Georgia has been a point of contention for our ancestors. Over the long centuries, Georgia, Armenia and the mountains of the Caucasus have been a place of struggle, where Roman, Persian and mercenary blood alike have been shed, drying in the old and wizened mountain valleys. Now, no vast, treacherous empire waits to challenge us - the region is ours for the picking, ours to dominate, ours to claim."
ghu_fortify_caucasus_title: "Fortify the Frontier"
ghu_fortify_caucasus_desc: "Georgia now under our control we must defend our Northern borders from any would be invaders. The Caucasus mountains provide a natural barrier, but we must also invest in fortifications and garrisons to ensure that our hold on the region remains unchallenged. By fortifying our frontier, we can protect our empire from external threats and ensure the stability and security of our realm."
