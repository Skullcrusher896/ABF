With vengeance on the menu, our advisors suggest we make from its ruins a city far greater, far more magnificent, far more wealthy than any seen before - a new Ctesiphon, a shining Ctesiphon!"
tcr_nahrawan_title: "The Nahrawan Canal"
tcr_nahrawan_desc: "During the times of Parthia, great works were undertaken along the Tigris and Euphrates to ensure water flowed where it was needed. Mesopotamia was fed by its convoluted, sprawling system of veins - farmers and peasants alike depending on the flow of its waters for sustenance and prosperity.

Robbed from us over a thousand years ago by the wily Alexander and his rabble of Macedonian curs, Egypt has since been torn apart - going from Greek, to Roman, to Arabic hands in the blink of an eye.

ABA_tcr_celestial_empire: "Yuezhi Celestial Empire"
ABA_tcr_celestial_empire_desc: "Having rejected the Mandate of Heaven but still proclaiming ourselves the sole rulers of China, we find ourselves in a unique position. We have combined the ways of the Yuezhi with the traditions of the Chinese, creating a new form of governance that reflects our dual heritage. By adopting this reform, we aim to streamline our bureaucratic processes, enhance our ability to manage diverse populations, and strengthen our overall state capacity. This change is expected to foster greater unity and stability within our realm, allowing us to better navigate the complexities of ruling a vast and culturally rich empire."

ABA_tcr_event.8.t: "The Ark of The Covenant"
ABA_tcr_event.8.d: "During our conquest of Ethiopia, our armies uncovered a hidden chamber deep within an ancient churche of Aksum. Inside, they found a magnificent artifact, said to be the very Ark of the Covenant itself. This sacred relic, believed to hold immense power and divine favor, has become the subject of intense debate. Its presence among us is a testament of our divine right to rule. We must now decide how to best honor and protect this holy artifact, ensuring that its power is used for the glory of our nation."

ABA_tcr_event.8.b: "It would be wise not to upset our new subjects, leave it be for now..."
ABA_tcr_event.9.t: "Fall of Khanbaliq"
ABA_tcr_event.9.d: "After a turbulent siege, Khanbaliq has finally succumbed to our strength of arms; its garrison's morale is destroyed, the gates reduced to kindling, and the empire's pride dragged through the mud. While the emperor and his sycophantic entourage may have fled, Yuan's treasury is largely intact, leaving us with a great abundance of plunder for the troops to divide as spoils of war. Alas, chaos is rampant in the streets, with panicking citizens - and even the imperial guard - engaging in widespread looting across affluent districts, while non-combatants desperately scramble to escape, or hurl themselves from the walls. It is abundantly clear now that the empire of Kublai Khan is in its death throes. From the ashes, we may rebuild China in our image!"

ABA_tcr_event.10.t: "A New Dynasty"
ABA_tcr_event.10.d: "With the fall of the Yuan dynasty, and rapid conquest of the squabbling warlord states, we have established ourselves as the new rulers of China. Our unique blend of Tocharian and Chinese cultures has created a vibrant and prosperous society that is unlike anything seen before. We have embraced the best aspects of both cultures, creating a new dynasty that is strong, prosperous, and united. Our people are proud of their heritage, and we are confident that our new dynasty will stand the test of time."
ABA_tcr_event.10.a: "Long live the §Jmem Yuezhi§!!"
ABA_tcr_event.11.t: "Reunification of the Celestial Empire"
ABA_tcr_event.11.d: "For many years, China has been divided along the Huai River between the rebel princedoms of the south and the ailing Yuan in the north. Taking advanatge of their temporary weakness and instability, Yuezhi banners fly from Khanbaliq to Nanjing to Guangzhou, achieving the dream of our forebearers. All of China lies under our control for the first time in decades, and our monarch has proclaimed their primacy as the sole Emperor of China. Now, we shall rule with a wise hand, following the great emperors who came before us."
ABA_tcr_event.11.a: "Let a new age §Jdawn§!!"
ABA_tcr_event.12.t: "Masters of India"
ABA_tcr_event.12.d: "We have finally achieved what our ancestors sought to so long ago. From the hills of Bactria to the sun-kissed coasts of Southern India, our banners fly supreme. The great Kushan Empire has been restored, and with it, our rightful place as the masters of India."

ABA_tcr_event.13.a: "Jai Hind!"
ABA_tcr_event.14.t: "Fate of Masjid al-Haram"
ABA_tcr_event.14.d: "With our conquest of the Arabian Peninsula complete, we have come to a crossroads regarding the fate of Masjid al-Haram, the holiest site in Islam. Some in our court suggest that we should preserve the mosque and allow it to continue to serve as a place of worship for Muslims around the world. Others believe that we should repurpose the site, transforming it into a glorious cathedral to commemorateour victory and as a symbol of our power. This is a difficult decision, but we must choose wisely. The fate of Masjid al-Haram will have far-reaching implications for our relations with the Muslim world and our own legitimacy as rulers."
ABA_tcr_event.14.a: "Convert the Mosque into a Church!"
ABA_tcr_event.14.b: "Preserve the site and tax the Pilgrims!"
ABA_tcr_event.15.t: "Landfall in Japan"
ABA_tcr_event.15.d: "We have done what the Mongols had failed to do for many centuries: We have made landfall in Japan. With the Yuan dynasty crumbling at our feet, and the fall of Toyouji puppets, we have opened the way for the conquest of Japan! Let us ride forth, and conquer the land of the rising sun!"
ABA_tcr_event.15.a: "The sun sets on the Japanese Empire!"
ABA_tcr_event.16.t: "City of the World's Desire"
ABA_tcr_event.16.d: "While we have done well to apperciate aspects of our Greek heritage, nothing erases the stain on the history of the Persian that was Alexande the Great's conquest of our lands. But now we have asserted ourselves as the true heirs of both the Persian and Greek worlds. With the capture of Constantinople, we have taken the city that has been the jewel of both empires for centuries. Now, we shall rebuild it in our image, creating a city that is worthy of being called the capital of the world."
ABA_tcr_event.16.a: "Forward to Glory!"
ABA_tcr_event.17.t: "The Great Temple of Mathura"
ABA_tcr_event.17.d:"In the days of yore, the mighty Kushan Empire erected many great monuments and temples as a testament to their faith. Regardless of the path we've chosen, we must honor this legacy and claim spiritual superiority over the realm through the construction of a new great work. A temple where followers of the true faith will flock from all over the world to gaze upon its glory. Today, we begin the construction of the Great Temple of Mathura!"
ABA_tcr_event.17.a: "Let construction begin!"
ABA_tcr_event.17.b: "Let construction begin!"
ABA_tcr_event.17.c: "Let construction begin!
ABA_tcr_event.18.t: "Matters of Faith"
ABA_tcr_event.18.d: "As we have continued our push into India, we find ourselves having grown much more diverse in the process. We now rule over Hindus, Muslims, Jains, Zoroastrians, and a myriad of other faiths. This presents both challenges and opportunities as we seek to unify our realm under a single banner, but the question remains: how do we approach this subject? Should we promote a policy of religious of tolerance and coexistence, or enforce our faith placing religious laws and customs at the center of our society?"
ABA_tcr_event.18.a: "§GThe Confederation is a home for all§!!"
