aba_bul_event.1.t: "Proclamation of the Third Bulgarian Empire"
aba_bul_event.1.d: "With the fall of the perfidious Byzantine Empire, and our subsequent domination of the Balkans, we have come to see ourselves as the true heirs of something new. Not the inheritors of Rome or even a continuation of the Second Bulgarian Empire, but something entirely new. We are the Third Bulgarian Empire, a fusion of the old and new, a beacon of hope and strength in a world that is constantly changing. We will embrace our Slavic heritage, while also incorporating the best aspects of the cultures we have conquered. May a new age dawn of the Slavic World under our watchful eye, a new Rome in the East!"
aba_bul_event.1.a: "The §YThird Bulgarian Empire§! is born!"
aba_bul_event.2.t: "The Question of the Volga Bulgarians"
aba_bul_event.2.d: "The Volga Bulgarians are our long lost wayward brothers. OVertime they have continued to embrace Turkic influences and even the Muslim faith, but they are still Bulgarians at heart. Some in our court suggest that we should bring them back into the fold, reuniting the Bulgarian people under one banner. This would be a bold move, but it would also be a risky one. The Volga Bulgarians are a proud people, and they may not take kindly to being ruled by us. We must weigh the pros and cons carefully before making a decision."
aba_bul_event.2.a: "Let them be! They are too far gone!"
aba_bul_event.2.b: "Drive them out! They are not true Bulgarians!"
