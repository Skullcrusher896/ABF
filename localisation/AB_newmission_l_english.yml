Sadly, ships cannot be used to cross the desert, but they can help project power in the surrounding area. In order for the world to fear the mighty Rob, we must first find a way to access the sea. The region of Makran is the perfect place to start."

################################## ZUN - Persia ##################################
zunp_zunbils_title: "Reunite the Zunbils"
zunp_zunbils_desc: "The Zunbils of Afghanistan have slowly faded into near obscurity. The last few remnants remain in the desolate mountains, far from any unifying force. The Zunbils can not fall; we will not let them. Rob will lead the unyielding Zuns into a glorious future, one where all of Persia can bathe in the light!"
zunp_overpower_title: "Overpower the Neighbours"
zunp_overpower_desc: "To state that we are weak would be a major understatement. Compared to our neighbours in the region, we have less troops, less wealth, less land, and less allies. Our first and most important priority is to ensure our survival by conscripting every peasant who can hold a sword into the military. Hopefully that will scare off our greedy neighbours."
zunp_unite_title: "Unite Afghanistan"
zunp_unite_desc: "Afghanistan has not been unified by Afghans for centuries. Foreign invasions and collapse have left little of a united Afghan state. Rob will fix that. All of Afghanistan will soon be praising the Zun as we prove ourselves as a powerful forces in the region."
zunp_fortify_title:  "Repair the Fortifications"
zunp_fortify_desc: "The greatest advantage we have is our natural terrain. Mountains and deserts make invading Afghanistan extremely difficult and frustrating. We should expand upon this and repair ancient fortifications all across the mountains to further frustrate and deter foreign threats."
zunp_graveyard_title: "Graveyard of Empires" 
zunp_graveyard_desc: "Afghanistan has been known throughout history as the graveyard of empires. Every empire that has attempted to conquer us quickly fell apart. Our people refuse to yield to foreign threats, and will make sure every invader suffers and waste all their resources attempting to hold us. We will be unconquerable, like our ancestors before us."
zunp_forward_title: "Beyond the Horizon"
zunp_forward_desc: "With the unification of Afghanistan we are left with the question of what to do next. Many look beyond the horizon towards Persia, eyeing its wealth and resources, and looking to spread the light of Zun to their heretical lands. Others suggest, due to mixed cultural heritage and religions, we should go toward India, and unite our Indian kin and teach them how to praise the sun."
zunp_coast_2_title: "Reach the Coast" 
zunp_coast_2_desc: "We spend so much time worshipping the sun in our mountains and deserts that we have not really focused on our navy. Sadly, ships cannot be used to cross the desert, but they can help project power in the surrounding area. In order for the world to fear the mighty Rob, we must first find a way to access the sea. The region of Makran is the perfect place to start." 
zun_adopt_cataphracts_title: "Adopt Cataphracts"
zun_adopt_cataphracts_desc: "The cataphracts are our elite cavalry units, enveloped in unpierceable suits of armor; they have defended Persia time and time again against Rome, and now they shall serve our empire's needs in battle once again."
zun_war_elephants_title: "Reintroduce War Elephants"
zun_war_elephants_desc: "Our army's efficacy has reached new heights. Intelligence, boldness, power and determination - our armies are known for these traits, led now by generals with decades of experience, fashioned into hordes of fearsome Cataphracts and brutal infantry. With this restored might, it is only fitting that we restore yet another pillar of our fallen legacy - the dreaded war elephant. The bones of our enemies shall be pounded to dust beneath their might!"
zun_revive_immortals_title: "Revive the Immortals"
zun_revive_immortals_desc: "Our proud history has been muddied and diluted over time. Legends stand out however - paramount among them, that of the Immortals. Recalled by ancient Persian and Roman scholars alike, the Immortals were fierce heavy infantry of great standing, numbering 10,000 at any given time, no more, no less. In service, they guarded not only our ruler, but the empire as a whole. With our military might and burgeoning empire, it seems right that we revive this legend and make our enemies cower!"
zun_shapurids_title: "Destory the Shapurids"
zun_shapurids_desc: "The Shapurids are a heretical sect, claiming descent from the ancient Sassanid kings. They have long been a thorn in our side, and it is time we put an end to their treachery. We must send our armies to crush them, and ensure that they never rise again. In the name of Zun!"
zun_illkhanate_title: "Execute the Ilkhan"
zun_illkhanate_desc: "Fallen and dilapidated as they are, the steppe fiends persist in their malice, exercising cruelty over the valleys of the Caucasus. They seek to bide their time - waiting for a new moment to raze, plunder and oppress. This cannot come to pass. Every last Mongol warlord must be brought to heel - so that Mongol rule, in the mind of every peasant, far and near, may become but a distant memory."
zun_fertile_crescent_title: "The Fertile Crescent"
zun_fertile_crescent_desc: "To our west, crowding the Tigris and the Euphrates, sits a world abused, in tatters and bereft of autonomy - a world where civilisation once blossomed and stood tall. At our height, we cradled the Fertile Crescent, bestowed upon it the respect it deserved. Now, we must do so again - drive out the barbarians which dare despoil it!"
zun_nahrawan_title: "Improve the Nahrawan"
zun_nahrawan_desc: "During the times of Parthia, great works were undertaken along the Tigris and Euphrates to ensure water flowed where it was needed. Mesopotamia was fed by its convoluted, sprawling system of veins - farmers and peasants alike depending on the flow of its waters for sustenance and prosperity. Barbaric infighting and countless wars have seen the canals abused and razed however. Now that we are back in charge, it is our divine duty to see these great works restored and Mesopotamia prosper."
zun_tribes_title: "Subjugate the Tribes"
zun_tribes_desc: "To the north, chaos reigns. Since time immemorial, fiendish savages have reigned over the steppe. Once in a blue moon, wise and humble peoples come forth from the maws of history to provide us with splendid company, but this cannot be counted upon. The steppe is dangerous and so are its inhabitants. We'd best bring the fight to them and subjugate their energies, lest they bring the fight to us."
zun_turkmen_title: "Recruit the Turkmen"
zun_turkmen_desc: "The steppe's southern extent has been conquered and tamed. Yet our nobles postulate more could be done. If we were to assimilate more tribes to our hegemony, integrate lands of key importance, we could in theory establish a monopoly on Turkic manpower. The steppe peoples yearn eternally for war, for glory, for coin - what better way to tame them than to give them what they want?
zun_observatory_title: "The Maragheh Observatory"
zun_observatory_desc: "Centuries ago, an observatory was constructed by the Ilkhanids just shy of the city of Maragheh. To their credit, many notable astronomers and scientists flocked to the site, pioneering strange new inventions and astronomical observations. Sadly, lack of patronage and neglect have reduced the observatory to a depleted husk. To celebrate our reclamation and restoration of Persia, we should restore the observatory!"
zun_georgia_title: "Devastate Georgia"
zun_georgia_desc: "Georgia has been a point of contention for our ancestors. Over the long centuries, Georgia, Armenia and the mountains of the Caucasus have been a place of struggle, where Roman, Persian and mercenary blood alike have been shed, drying in the old and wizened mountain valleys. Now, no vast, treacherous empire waits to challenge us - the region is ours for the picking, ours to dominate, ours to claim."
zun_seljuks_title: "Chasten the Seljuks"
zun_seljuks_desc: "The Seljuk Turks once shredded through Persia. Like the foul marauders they are, they wandered west, burning and desecrating all in sight until choosing to settle in the east of Anatolia. Their current rulers, their current peasantry, their current nobles, may have all forgotten their history, how their ancestors plundered us - but we have not. In due time, the Turks will be punished for their misdeeds - retribution will come."
zun_byzantium_title: "March on Constantinople"
zun_byzantium_desc: "Across the glimmering waters of the Bosporus sits a city eternal - the city of Constantinople, founded and pioneered by its namesake simply to situate the Roman power structure closer to our borders, to keep us at bay. Countless hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of our ancestors, bled in the once-endless struggle against Roman tyranny. To capture Constantinople, to subjugate Thrace, to advance upon the wretched coastlines of Greece, would be to restore our honour and avenge our ancestors."
zun_persianize_turks_title: "Persianize the Turks"
zun_persianize_turks_desc: "Anatolia is ours and with it, a sizable population of Turks. Their tenacity and wealth of manpower cannot be denied - they would make a fine addition to the empire, should they be educated and civilised. If we were to rid them of the various accumulated traditions and tongues clinging to them, we could assimilate the Turks beneath our cultural banner - make them Iranians, well and true, for centuries to come."
zun_levanite_incursion_title: "Levantine Incursion"
zun_levanite_incursion_desc: "Before the Muslims, before the Christians, before Alexander, the Levant was a wing of our empire. Persian rule stretched from Gaza to Ghor - simpler, better times, which were robbed from us by heathens, barbarians and treacherous ravagers. With the Levant tantalisingly close, our generals, our armies, yearn to reclaim what was once ours - and just one triumph could empower our military's morale to blazing heights unseen."
zun_capture_jerusalem_title: "Capture Jerusalem"
zun_capture_jerusalem_desc: "Muslims, Christians and Jews alike squabble over a city nestled beside the Dead Sea. With so many lives lost to a damnable wall, a bemusing hill and the coveted remains of a cross with so many fabled pieces that one could fashion a fleet from it, it'd probably be best if the city were ruled by us. Thousands of years of wars and conflicts over this city will finally ended..."
zun_reclaim_egypt_title: "Reclaim Egypt"
zun_reclaim_egypt_desc: "Egypt was a jewel of our empire. It is an ancient granary, a heartland of North Africa, the western extent of old Persia. Robbed from us over a thousand years ago by the wily Alexander and his rabble of Macedonian curs, Egypt has since been torn apart - going from Greek, to Roman, to Arabic hands in the blink of an eye. We must spread the light of Zun to this land, and reclaim what is rightfully ours!"
zun_heart_of_islam_title: "Heart of Islam"
zun_heart_of_islam_desc: "Through the rugged mountains south of the Levant, one can find the Kaaba - the heart of the Muslim faith, the source of Dar al-Islam. Much like Jerusalem, the fabled beating heart of Islam could become under our command. The control of [385.GetName] marks our claim to the whole Arabia. All of the Muslim world will soon bow before us."
zun_terminus_title: "Terminus of the Silk Road"
zun_terminus_desc: "Egypt is in our grasp and our empire greets the Mediterranean with open arms, welcoming its riches and eager merchants as if they were old friends. This has not come without issue, however - greedy Europeans have leapt at the chance to exploit the turmoil, slipping into a kind of economic power vacuum to garner as much wealth as possible. We must have none of it - Aleppo and Alexandria bow to US, it is OUR coin which reigns here! Only through Persia can the lifeblood of the Silk Road be ferried!"
zun_damsacus_steel_title: "Damascus Steel"
zun_damsacus_steel_desc: "The city of Damascus is famed for its steel. The finest swords and blades in the world are forged here, and it is time we harness this power for ourselves. We must invest in the expansion of the steel industry, and ensure that our armies have access to the finest weapons in the world."
zun_global_purification_title: "Global Purification"
zun_global_purification_desc: "The world looks upon Zun with pity and hatred The Zoroastrians think of us as a weird cult, the Muslims view us as disgusting heathens, and the Christians all the same. Yet we stand before them not as equals, but as superiors. They will fear the Wrath of Zun, as our crusaders scorch their countryside with the might of the Zun."
zunp_rebuild_title: "Rebuild Ghazni" 
zunp_rebuild_desc: "Ghazni was one of the most important cities in all of ancient Persia. It served as a crossroads between the Middle East and India. After years of conquests and sackings, it is nothing more than a small village built around great citadels and ruins. Ghazni must be rebuilt as the centre of our new empire, linking the east and west once again." 
zunp_court_title: "Perso-Indian Court" 
zunp_court_desc: "Persian ways of thinking and Indian ways of thinking have not always gone hand in hand, but it would be idiotic of us to deny the Indians a seat in our government just because of their race. Indians and Persians will walk together as the united superpowers of the world."
zunp_cloth_title: "Expand the Cloth Industry" 
zunp_cloth_desc: "One of the most valuable trades in the Indus valley is the cloth trade. Wool has become such a valued commodity that nations as far as Europe seek Indian clothing. We need to control such a profitable trade and expand it to meet the ever growing demand." 
zunp_silk_road_title: "Monopolise the Silk Road"  
zunp_silk_road_desc: "The Silk Road is ancient, with thousands of years of history and commerce having left major impacts on all stops. Not since the time of the Mongols has one nation truly dominated the Silk Road. Now, we have been presented the opportunity to control the Silk Road. We cannot let this opportunity go." 
zunp_industralize_title: "Industrialize the Cloth Trade"
zunp_industralize_desc: "Despite how valuable the cloth industry is, it is still costly to produce the cloth `in the first place. Fortunately, the power of the sun is now in the palm of our hands, as new techniques allow for production rates to skyrocket. Production shall increase and so shall our profits!"
zunp_cities_title: "Control the Trading Cities" 
zunp_cities_desc: "The most important part to maintaining our hegemony over the Silk Road is the control of vital trade cities across it. Without these trade cities, the road will either become unsafe, or be replaced by other routes that are more profitable. This network of trade cities will be expanded upon and turned into the centre of all global trade."
zunp_shrines_title: "Patronise the Shrines" 
zunp_shrines_desc: "Local shrines to Zun dot all across our fledgling empire. Sadly, these shrines are unorganised and lack a cohesive doctrine to preach. Patronising these local shrines and turning them into pilgrimage sites for our faithful will help unify the followers of Zun." 
zunp_caravans_title: "Expand the Caravan Trade"
zunp_caravans_desc: "Caravans are the lifeblood of trade in our empire. They are the ones who brave the dangers of bandits and rough terrain to bring goods to market. We must invest in the expansion of the caravan trade, and ensure that our merchants have access to the wealth and resources of this vast and diverse land."
zunp_sah_bahar_title: "Temple of The King"
zunp_sah_bahar_desc: "The Temple of The King is an ancient Zun temple located in the heart of our empire. It is a place of great spiritual significance, and it is essential that we invest in its restoration and upkeep. The temple will serve as a beacon of faith for our people, and a symbol of our legitimacy as the true rulers of Persia and India."
zunp_wrath_title: "The Wrath of Zun"
zunp_wrath_desc: "The world looks upon Zun with pity and hatred. The Zoroastrians think of us as a weird cult, the Muslims view us as disgusting heathens, and the Christians all the same. Yet we stand before them not as equals, but as superiors. They will fear the Wrath of Zun, as our crusaders scorch their countryside with the might of the Zun."
zun_secure_coast_title: "Secure the Coastline"
zun_secure_coast_desc: "The Persian Gulf is a den of trade. Merchants from far and wide traverse its rocky coastlines to ferry the whimsical riches of India to the proud zealots of the Levant. As a result, it has rich maritime foundations, as well as well-worn, critical defensive positions and valuable ports. Securing the southern coastline will grant us naval supremacy over our regional rivals."
zun_meshan_title: "Recover Meshan"
zun_meshan_desc: "Shy of our most recent coastal acquisitions is Meshan - the gates to old Mesopotamia and the twin rivers of the Tigris and the Euphrates. Establishing a foothold will establish for us a monopoly - a mercantile handhold which we can grip, squeeze, clench, wrangle every last coin and gem from. Meshan must return to our fold - so that our neighbours may know true hunger, true poverty, and beg for our overlordship."
zun_monopolize_title: "Monopolise the Gulf"
zun_monopolize_desc: "With the southern coastline in our grip, we may begin to compete with the wily Hormuzi and the bold Hindus. Should we strengthen our mercantile muscles, empower our regional merchants and secure trade within the region, we could easily dominate the Gulf's commerce and establish an unbreakable monopoly for centuries to come."'
zun_gerrha_title: "Claim Gerrha"
zun_gerrha_desc: "To the south of Meshan is Gerrha - a vital Arabian coastline, rife with fierce commercial competition. For centuries, the Khaleeji of Arabia have competed valiantly with our native merchants - but no more, we say. With our resurgent strength, we may conquer and assimilate this region, making it a vital addition to our blossoming trade empire."
zun_mazun_title: "Conquer Mazun"
zun_mazun_desc: "A symbolic victory is in sight. Mazun, heartland of the Khaleeji, the Hormuzi merchants our empire tirelessly competes against, sits at our feet. Helpless and petty, they may fall to our efforts - and with the tip of Arabia in our grasp, a monopoly, a domination outright of the Indian Ocean, could be within our grasp, securing our place in the world as a naval hegemon to be feared.'
