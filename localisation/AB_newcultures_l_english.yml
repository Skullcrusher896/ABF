#Events
#Japan
 aba_japan_events.1.t: "Sinification of Japan?"
 aba_japan_events.1.d: "Once, long ago, Chinese and Confucian ideas spread across Japan, influencing our cultural and political development till this day. Taking the mantle of the emperor of China, many in our court are considering embracing our historical Chinese influence and adopting the customs and traditions of the Chinese, just as many invaders had done before. Some say this would allow us to better integrate with our Chinese subjects and strengthen our ties with the Middle Kingdom. Others claim that this would be a betrayal of our own culture and traditions, and that we should instead focus on strengthening our own identity. The question is, what path should we take?"
 aba_japan_events.1.a: "It is time to complete what started years ago..."
 aba_japan_events.1.b: "We will not bend the knee!" 
# Golden Horde
 aba_glh_events.1.t: "The Golden Tsardom"
 aba_glh_events.1.d: "We have truimphed over the squabbling states of Rus, asserting ourselves as the true heirs of Ruthenia. With our modernized bureaucracy and insitutions, we must fully embrace the traditions of the Ruthenians to ensure a lasting legacy and their loyalty."
 aba_glh_events.1.a: "We are Ruthenians, God is with us!"
#Brittany
 aba_brittany_event.1.d: "In the early 17th Century, the Welsh intelligencia began to formulate a new kind of thought around their culture and people. They harkened back to the period of legend and myth prior to the Anglo-Saxon invasion, when the Britons ruled the isle alongside the Romans. These Brittonic Revivalists were scoffed at by most as delusional, as fools that were pretending to be something they were not. However, some found this idea interesting, specifically the nobility who liked to dress themselves in titles and names as to feel more regal. Common folk cared little for it, as these prancing nobles still spoke Welsh or whatever language they were native to. Recently, however, the idea has seen another massive surge in popularity, spreading throughout the growing middle class and cities, with hundreds of thousands now calling themselves 'Britons'. This has been causing tensions with those who view the idea as ridiculous, and among those who are not Welsh, it is considered even more confusing and angering. Our lord, [Root.Monarch.GetName], pondered what to do about this growing movement, eventually deciding to sponsor and support this new movement, calling the subjects of the British Isles true Britons. This would be seen as the start of the Brittonic Revolution."
 aba_brittany_event.1.t: "The Rise of the Britons"
 aba_brittany_event.1.a: "The §GRevival§! of the §YBrittonic Culture§! begins"
 aba_brittany_event.2.t: "The Revolution Spreads!"
 aba_brittany_event.2.d: "Another noble accepts the truth of our heritage. It will take some time for the people to catch on, but with the nobility of the province on our side, it won't be long before the people too accept their Brittonic Past."
 aba_brittany_event.3.t: "Britons Entrenched"
 aba_brittany_event.3.d: "The populace of the province now accept Britons. While they still speak and act in the exact same ways as before, they now sing songs and write plays of the Britons. They speak of themselves less as residence of a town or village, but as a people of a community of Britons."
 aba_brittany_event.4.t: "Resistance from Locals"
 aba_brittany_event.4.d: "The local population refuses to withdraw their customs and heritage. Some believe that we are going to replace their language and faith and have accused our lord of being a tyrant. We stand against these accusations, but it is too late, and the populace has been whipped into a fury. We must calm them down somehow."
 aba_brittany_event.5.t: "Nobles are Intrigued"
 aba_brittany_event.5.d: "Nobles in this province have begun to look into the Brittonic Revolution and are interested in what they see. They are asking for us to help them understand it more, and even send money to set up institutions to study and theorize about their people's past. Should we support this venture, their acceptance of the new idea would be far more likely than if we simply leave it alone."
 aba_brittany_event.6.t: "Briton Domination"
 aba_brittany_event.6.d: "With the majority of our home islands joining the Brittonic Revolution, the anxiety and anger towards it has cooled down significantly. Now, we can once more focus on spreading and expanding our empire, but now we do so as Britons!"
 aba_brittany_event.7.t: "The Essex Revolt"
 aba_brittany_event.7.d: "The Lords of Essex found our Brittonic Revolution to be an opportunity. They used it to whip the local lords and peasants into a fury around our king, calling them a tyrant that wishes to wipe out all of the Anglo-Saxons. Many lords who both feared the revolution as well as those who simply wished for more authority and power, joined in with the lord. Across East Anglia, London, and Kent, lords tore down their banners and declared their support for their new lord in Essex!"
 aba_brittany_event.8.t: "The Highlander Revolt"
 aba_brittany_event.8.d: "The Highlanders of Scotland had disliked the Brittonic Revolution. A very real aspect of this revolution was the suppression and removal of local customs via the lords who practiced this new doctrine, some of whom would use their new authority from the crown to punish and imprison those who still followed the old traditions. This very case happened in the Highlands, and several lords of the old Kingdoms joined together to throw off their Briton lords, declaring themselves an independent Kingdom."
 aba_brittany_event.9.t: "The Irish Revolt"
 aba_brittany_event.9.d: "The Irish people have always had a separate and unique identity to that of the British. The revolt of 1395 and the subsequent liberation of Irish settlements in the south from English control only furthered that divide, viewing themselves as distinct from the other Isles. This new revival angered the remnants of the Old High King's court, who gathered in the southern Munster region to begin plotting their rebellion. When they gathered enough support from the populace, they declared their independence from the Britons, claiming the title of High King of Ireland once more."
ab_brittany.3.t: "The Gaelic Faith"
ab_brittany.3.d: "With the revival of the Gallic culture, many have begun to look into the old faith of our ancestors, the ancient Celtic polytheism that was practiced before the coming of Christianity. While many scoff at this idea, it has gained a significant following among the common folk and some of the nobility. Our lord, [Root.Monarch.GetName], has decided to combine ascepts of this faith with those of Christianity, seeing it as a way to further distance ourselves from the French and their influence. This decision has been met with mixed reactions, with some seeing it as a bold move towards independence, while others view it as a dangerous step towards heresy. Regardless, we must now navigate the challenges that come with this new faith and its place in our society."
ab_brittany.3.a: "A new faith for a new age..."
ab_brittany.3.b: "These are only the delusions of a madman!"
#####POLAND
aba_pol_events.1.T: "The Founding of Krakow University"
aba_pol_events.1.d: "The city of Krakow has long been a center of culture and learning in our nation. However, it lacks a formal institution of higher education that can rival those found in other European countries. To address this, we have decided to establish a university in Krakow. This university will serve as a hub for intellectual and cultural exchange, attracting scholars and students from across Europe. It will also help to promote the Polish language and culture, which has been overshadowed by Latin and German in academic circles. The university will be modeled after the great universities of Bologna and Paris, with a focus on theology, law, medicine, and the arts. We will also establish a library and a printing press to facilitate the dissemination of knowledge. The founding of Krakow University is a significant step forward for our nation, and we are confident that it will help to elevate Poland's status as a center of learning and culture in Europe."
#####SHAHI
AB_Shahi_Event.8.T: "The Indian Century"
AB_Shahi_Event.8.D: "With our conquest of Indian nearing its end and the establishment of our rule over the subcontinent, we have entered a new era in our history. This era is marked by the fusion of Afghan and Indian cultures, which has created a unique and vibrant society that is unlike anything seen before. We have embraced the rich traditions and customs of India, while also maintaining our Afghan heritage. This fusion has led to the development of new art forms, music, and literature that reflect the diverse influences of our people. We have also adopted new technologies and ideas from India, which have helped to modernize our economy and society. The Indian Century is a time of great opportunity and promise for our nation, and we are excited to see what the future holds."
AB_Shahi_Event.8.a: "The §YIndian Century§! begins... We will now be known as the §GShahistan§!"
AB_Shahi_Event.8.b: "The §YIndian Century§! begins!"
#### Hetmanate:

aba_hetmanate.1.d: "Our integration of Poland has gone well. Fusing their frontier spirit and will to survive with the martial prowess of the Cossacks has produced unpredecented results. Their famed Hussar regiments have pledged themselves to our cause of liberty and freedom."
aba_hetmanate.1.a: "And the Winged Hussars Arrived!"
##### Zun
aba_zun_event.1.t: "Our Destiny"
aba_zun_event.1.d: "Through Faith we emerged victorious, and now our humble nation lies at a crossroads. We turn to the annals of history looking for a direction. Some in our court suggest we claim the mantle of the Persian Empire, and take advantage of the chaos left in the wake of the collapsing Illkhanate. While others say we should turn towards the East, and feast on the riches of India. It is time to decide the fate of our nation."
aba_zun_event.1.a: "Let the sun set over Hindustan!"
aba_zun_event.1.b: "We shall bring the Fire of Zun to the West!"
aba_zun_event.2.t: "The Synthesis"
aba_zun_event.2.d: "With our conquest of India, we have come to embrace the rich and diverse culture of the subcontinent. Our people have adopted many Indian customs and traditions, and we have even begun to incorporate Indian art and architecture into our own. This fusion of cultures has created a unique and vibrant society that is unlike anything seen before. We have also embraced elements of the Indian religion of Hinduism, which has become a major part of our spiritual life. The synthesis of Zunist and Indian cultures has led to a new era of prosperity and enlightenment for our nation, and we are excited to see what the future holds But some in court suggest we enforce our heritage instead of adopting this new culture."
aba_zun_event.2.a: "The §YSynthesis§! of §JAfghan Culture§! and §OIndian§! cultures begins..."
aba_zun_event.2.b: "We shall enforce the §RZunist§! faith and §RAfghan§! culture on the world!"
aba_zun_event.3.t: "Global Purification"
aba_zun_event.3.d: "Our faith has guided us to victory, and now it is time to spread its light to the rest of the world. We will embark on a massive campaign to crush the false gods that many of these heretics and heathens pray to. We've already destroyed their holy sites, but this is simply not enough to show them the falsity of their ways. We will send missionaries to every corner of the globe, preaching the truth of Zun and converting those who are willing to listen. For those who refuse, we will show them the true power of our faith through force if necessary..."
##### Bulgaria
aba_bul_event.1.t: "Proclamation of the Third Bulgarian Empire"
aba_bul_event.1.d: "With the fall of the perfidious Byzantine Empire, and our subsequent domination of the Balkans, we have come to see ourselves as the true heirs of something new. Not the inheritors of Rome or even a continuation of the Second Bulgarian Empire, but something entirely new. We are the Third Bulgarian Empire, a fusion of the old and new, a beacon of hope and strength in a world that is constantly changing. We will embrace our Slavic heritage, while also incorporating the best aspects of the cultures we have conquered. May a new age dawn of the Slavic World under our watchful eye, a new Rome in the East!"
aba_bul_event.1.a: "The §YThird Bulgarian Empire§! is born!"
aba_bul_event.2.t: "The Question of the Volga Bulgarians"
aba_bul_event.2.d: "The Volga Bulgarians are our long lost wayward brothers. OVertime they have continued to embrace Turkic influences and even the Muslim faith, but they are still Bulgarians at heart. Some in our court suggest that we should bring them back into the fold, reuniting the Bulgarian people under one banner. This would be a bold move, but it would also be a risky one. The Volga Bulgarians are a proud people, and they may not take kindly to being ruled by us. We must weigh the pros and cons carefully before making a decision."
aba_bul_event.2.a: "Let them be! They are too far gone!"
aba_bul_event.2.b: "Drive them out! They are not true Bulgarians!"
##### Tocharia
ABA_tcr_event.1.t: "Nexus of Two Worlds"
ABA_tcr_event.1.d: "Our land lies at the crossroads of two great civilizations, the East and the West. For centuries, we have been a melting pot of cultures, religions, and ideas. Our people have embraced the best of both worlds, creating a unique and vibrant society that is unlike anything seen before. We have adopted elements of both Eastern and Western cultures, blending them together in a way that is uniquely Tocharian. This fusion has led to a new era of prosperity and enlightenment for our nation, but we are left with the question, which world do we want to be a part of?"
ABA_tcr_event.1.a: "We shall revive the legacy of the §JKushan Empire§!!"
ABA_tcr_event.1.b: "We shall claim the glory of the §GPersian Empire§!!"

ABA_tcr_event.2.d: "Having chosen our path, we now must fully embrace it.

ABA_tcr_event.8.t: "The Ark of The Covenant"
ABA_tcr_event.8.d: "During our conquest of Ethiopia, our armies uncovered a hidden chamber deep within an ancient churche of Aksum. Inside, they found a magnificent artifact, said to be the very Ark of the Covenant itself. This sacred relic, believed to hold immense power and divine favor, has become the subject of intense debate. Its presence among us is a testament of our divine right to rule. We must now decide how to best honor and protect this holy artifact, ensuring that its power is used for the glory of our nation."
ABA_tcr_event.8.a: "The Ark shall be enshrined in our capital!"
ABA_tcr_event.8.b: "It would be wise not to upset our new subjects, leave it be for now..."
ABA_tcr_event.9.t: "Fall of Khanbaliq"
ABA_tcr_event.9.d: "After a turbulent siege, Khanbaliq has finally succumbed to our strength of arms; its garrison's morale is destroyed, the gates reduced to kindling, and the empire's pride dragged through the mud. While the emperor and his sycophantic entourage may have fled, Yuan's treasury is largely intact, leaving us with a great abundance of plunder for the troops to divide as spoils of war. Alas, chaos is rampant in the streets, with panicking citizens - and even the imperial guard - engaging in widespread looting across affluent districts, while non-combatants desperately scramble to escape, or hurl themselves from the walls. It is abundantly clear now that the empire of Kublai Khan is in its death throes. From the ashes, we may rebuild China in our image!"
ABA_tcr_event.9.a: "The Mongol menace has been vanquished!"
ABA_tcr_event.10.t: "A New Dynasty"
ABA_tcr_event.10.d: "With the fall of the Yuan dynasty, and rapid conquest of the squabbling warlord states, we have established ourselves as the new rulers of China. Our unique blend of Tocharian and Chinese cultures has created a vibrant and prosperous society that is unlike anything seen before. We have embraced the best aspects of both cultures, creating a new dynasty that is strong, prosperous, and united. Our people are proud of their heritage, and we are confident that our new dynasty will stand the test of time."
ABA_tcr_event.10.a: "Long live the §Jmem Yuezhi§!!"
ABA_tcr_event.11.t: "Reunification of the Celestial Empire"
ABA_tcr_event.11.d: "For many years, China has been divided along the Huai River between the rebel princedoms of the south and the ailing Yuan in the north. Taking advanatge of their temporary weakness and instability, Yuezhi banners fly from Khanbaliq to Nanjing to Guangzhou, achieving the dream of our forebearers. All of China lies under our control for the first time in decades, and our monarch has proclaimed their primacy as the sole Emperor of China. Now, we shall rule with a wise hand, following the great emperors who came before us."
ABA_tcr_event.11.a: "Let a new age §Jdawn§!!"
ABA_tcr_event.12.t: "Masters of India"
ABA_tcr_event.12.d: "We have finally achieved what our ancestors sought to so long ago. From the hills of Bactria to the sun-kissed coasts of Southern India, our banners fly supreme. The great Kushan Empire has been restored, and with it, our rightful place as the masters of India."

ABA_tcr_event.13.t: "Rajput Regiments Arrive"
ABA_tcr_event.13.d: "Our conquest of India has gone well. Fusing their martial prowess with our own military traditions has produced unpredecented results. Their famed Rajput regiments have pledged themselves to our cause of unity and strength."
ABA_tcr_event.13.a: "Jai Hind!"
ABA_tcr_event.14.t: "Fate of Masjid al-Haram"
ABA_tcr_event.14.d: "With our conquest of the Arabian Peninsula complete, we have come to a crossroads regarding the fate of Masjid al-Haram, the holiest site in Islam. Some in our court suggest that we should preserve the mosque and allow it to continue to serve as a place of worship for Muslims around the world. Others believe that we should repurpose the site, transforming it into a glorious cathedral to commemorateour victory and as a symbol of our power. This is a difficult decision, but we must choose wisely. The fate of Masjid al-Haram will have far-reaching implications for our relations with the Muslim world and our own legitimacy as rulers."
ABA_tcr_event.14.a: "Convert the Mosque into a Church!"
ABA_tcr_event.14.b: "Preserve the site and tax the Pilgrims!"
ABA_tcr_event.15.t: "Landfall in Japan"
ABA_tcr_event.15.d: "We have done what the Mongols had failed to do for many centuries: We have made landfall in Japan. With the Yuan dynasty crumbling at our feet, and the fall of Toyouji puppets, we have opened the way for the conquest of Japan! Let us ride forth, and conquer the land of the rising sun!"
ABA_tcr_event.15.a: "The sun sets on the Japanese Empire!"
ABA_tcr_event.16.t: "City of the World's Desire"
ABA_tcr_event.16.d: "While we have done well to apperciate aspects of our Greek heritage, nothing erases the stain on the history of the Persian that was Alexande the Great's conquest of our lands. But now we have asserted ourselves as the true heirs of both the Persian and Greek worlds. With the capture of Constantinople, we have taken the city that has been the jewel of both empires for centuries. Now, we shall rebuild it in our image, creating a city that is worthy of being called the capital of the world."
ABA_tcr_event.16.a: "Forward to Glory!"
ABA_tcr_event.17.t: "The Great Temple of Mathura"
ABA_tcr_event.17.d:"In the days of yore, the mighty Kushan Empire erected many great monuments and temples as a testament to their faith. Regardless of the path we've chosen, we must honor this legacy and claim spiritual superiority over the realm through the construction of a new great work. A temple where followers of the true faith will flock from all over the world to gaze upon its glory. Today, we begin the construction of the Great Temple of Mathura!"
ABA_tcr_event.17.a: "Let construction begin!"
ABA_tcr_event.17.b: "Let construction begin!"
ABA_tcr_event.17.c: "Let construction begin!
ABA_tcr_event.18.t: "Matters of Faith"
ABA_tcr_event.18.d: "As we have continued our push into India, we find ourselves having grown much more diverse in the process. We now rule over Hindus, Muslims, Jains, Zoroastrians, and a myriad of other faiths. This presents both challenges and opportunities as we seek to unify our realm under a single banner, but the question remains: how do we approach this subject? Should we promote a policy of religious of tolerance and coexistence, or enforce our faith placing religious laws and customs at the center of our society?"
ABA_tcr_event.18.a: "§GThe Confederation is a home for all§!!"
ABA_tcr_event.18.b: "§RHeretics and Heathens deserve no pity...§!"
