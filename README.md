[h1] Introduction [/h1]

Every time I've played Ante Bellum, I've always enjoyed the long missions trees with cultural conversion aspects, making my own head canon for the nations I play along the way. But many nations don't have the option to shape the malleable cultural identities that inhabit the world of Ante Bellum.

Today I bring to you Ante Bellum Flavor, a mod focused on light adjustments to Ante Bellum for the purposes of immersion and subtle gameplay enhancements. Similar to Halfdan's mod, this mod seeks to create a more lived in and dynamic world, with new gameplay options, primarily for nations that have not received an update or a mini-update in a long time.

#### Features so far  ###
-30+ new spawnable cultures! (For Germans, Norse, Slavs, and more!)
-New Government reforms!
-Enhanced integration into India and Persia for Afghan nations
-Take the Mandate of Heaven as Japan, and embrace your Sinic roots!
-Claim the mantle of Ruthenia as the Golden Horde/Tartaria, establish your own Tsardom!
-Unique government form for the Danubian Federation
-Continue the Crusade as Sweden, employing Carolean Paladins and integrating the Finnish into your culture group!
- Assert the dominance of Gallic culture and revive Brittonic culture!
- Restore Slavic Hegemony in Germany as Wendia!
- Become the masters of India as Shahi, Ghor, Zun, or Tocharia now with unique assimilation mechanics and bonuses!
- Colonize the vast Steppes after defeating the Golden Horde with new Cossack settler cultures!
- 7 New Monuments!
- New Mission Trees!: Catholic Poland, Shahi of Afghanistan, the Hetmanate/Zaz, Bulgaria!, and two massive branching mission trees for Zun/Rob, Tocharia (and all the nations that form it), Ghurids, and Lendia!
  -Thanks to suoncha (creator of The Lost World), you can seamlessly switch between mission trees using the "Switch Button" available to Zun for the time! 


(Full list of features in Change log)

I plan to continue adding more smaller gameplay adjustments like these to the mod, as well as updated and enhanced mission trees in line with Ante Bellum's gameplay philosophy later down the line.

Big thank you to Potion Seller (Check out their great mission trees and modifications), suoncha (creator of The Lost World), and NewYoung (ABE) for all their help getting this off the ground!

Compatible with The Lost World, this along with the map borders overhaul are required submods for the The Lost World Now,
