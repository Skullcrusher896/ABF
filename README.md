Every time I've played Ante Bellum, I've always enjoyed the long missions trees with cultural conversion aspects, making my own head canon for the nations I play along the way. But many nations don't have the option to shape the malleable cultural identities that inhabit the world of Ante Bellum.

Today I bring to you Ante Bellum Flavor - Expanded Content, a mod focused on light adjustments to Ante Bellum for the purposes of immersion and subtle gameplay enhancements. Similar to Halfdan's mod, this mod seeks to create a more lived in and dynamic world, with new gameplay options, primarily for nations that have not received an update or a mini-update in a long time.

Features so far:
- 15 new spawnable cultures! (For Germans, Norse, Slavs, and more!)
- Enhanced integration into India and Persia for Afghan nations
- Take the Mandate of Heaven as Japan, and embrace your Sinic roots!
- Claim the mantle of Ruthenia as the Golden Horde/Tartaria, establish your own Tsardom!
- Unique government form for the Danubian Federation
- Continue the Crusade as Sweden, employing Carolean Paladins and integrating the Finnish into your culture group!
- Assert the dominance of Gallic culture and revive Brittonic culture!

I plan to continue adding more smaller gameplay adjustments like these to the mod, as well as updated and enhanced mission trees in line with Ante Bellum's gameplay philosophy later down the line.

Big thank you to Potion Seller (Check out their great mission trees and modifications), suoncha (creator of The Lost World), and NewYoung (ABE) for all their help getting this off the ground!

To install create a new mod using the Paradox launcher, and add Ante Bellum as a dependency to the descriptor file, and then copy over all files into your new mod folder.
